title: "An Experiment with Arch and i3 Tiling Windows Manager"
date: 2015-08-08

I've needed to do something with my Dell Precision M4800 laptop for a while now. I had previously
attempted to install [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) on it, but ran into trouble with getting 
[Bumblebee](http://bumblebee-project.org/) installed in order to properly handle the dual video cards in 
the laptop.

That was about a year ago, and I'm ready to jump back into it and try again. I've been using Linux
and Emacs a lot at work, and now I really want to work out of an environment where I can use the
keyboard much more and keep the OS out of my way when I want to work. For that reason, I plan to
try Arch again and combine it with the [i3 Tiling Window Manager](https://i3wm.org/). I plan to do 
something similar to my Desktop at some point, but I figured it would be nice to have something more 
mobile in my laptop to carry my work with my while the summer remains.

So, here goes nothing! This post will service as both the introduction and sort of a "Table of Contents"
of my, hopefully, future posts on the subject.
