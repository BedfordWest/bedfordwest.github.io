title: "Bedford West, Software Engineer, Launches Site"

After struggling with finding the time and energy to launch my public facing site
while also maintaining my other professional and creative endeavors, I've decided
to try out GitHub pages with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to maintain my site and blog.
This is the first post resulting from this effort.

So far, the whole thing is pretty easy and quick to set up. It takes only a few minutes,
and so long as you have a basic understanding of markdown and git, everything is very
straightforward.

My hope is to maintain a professional and technical blog on here where I comment on tech news
as well as provide updates on my personal projects. We'll see how everything goes!
