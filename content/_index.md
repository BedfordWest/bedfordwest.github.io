# Hi! 🙋 I’m Bedford (he/him/his). I'm a software engineering leader 💻 with a particular passion for advancing the developer experience through growth and psychological safety 🌱.
<br />

#### My philosophy toward engineering is driven whole-heartedly by one simple belief: On a software development team, we’re all learners and we’re all in this together 👪. For me, this means understanding more about what makes engineers engaged, psychologically safe, and fulfilled 💚. As an engineering leader, this means I do my best to get to know each and every member of my department, understand their motivations, and work tirelessly toward earning their trust and advancing their careers.
 <br />

#### Most importantly, I am totally committed toward advancing 👌👌🏻👌🏼👌🏽👌🏾👌🏿 diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging ❤️ 🧡 💛 💚 💙 💜 in technology and beyond. I believe in the importance of actively participating in and advocating for these issues whenever I am able. We are at our best as technologists when we correct inequities in our workforce and push for safe, inclusive environments for everyone.
<br />

#### In my down time, I enjoy building and expressing my creative side and keeping my tech skills relevant through game development 👾.
