# Hi! ðŸ™‹ Iâ€™m Bedford (he/him/his). I'm a software engineering leader ðŸ’» with a particular passion for advancing the developer experience through growth and psychological safety ðŸŒ±.
<br />

#### My philosophy toward engineering is driven whole-heartedly by one simple belief: On a software development team, weâ€™re all learners and weâ€™re all in this together ðŸ‘ª. For me, this means understanding more about what makes engineers engaged, psychologically safe, and fulfilled ðŸ’š. As an engineering leader, this means I do my best to get to know each and every member of my department, understand their motivations, and work tirelessly toward earning their trust and advancing their careers.
 <br />

#### In my down time, I enjoy building and expressing my creative side and keeping my tech skills relevant through game development ðŸ‘¾.
