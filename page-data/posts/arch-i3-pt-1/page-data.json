As expected, things did not go smoothly, initially. One thing I enjoy about trying something like Arch out, however, is that you really get your hands dirty and have to work to achieve your goals.</p>\n<p>The first time I attempted this installation a little over a year ago, things went smoothly until I needed to install my video drivers and attempt to have Xorg display some basic output to my screen. You see, the Dell Precision M4800 laptop I have actually comes with two video adapters (one integrated Intel and one high-performance Nvidia) which utilize a technology called Nvidia Optimus. The thing is, Nvidia is notorious for having proprietary driver conflicts with Linux, and this technology only adds to that conundrum.</p>\n<p>It turns out this most recent install of Arch met with much the same fate. I was able to get a basic installation going just fine by following the Arch Beginner’s Guide. The problem came immediately after finishing this guide, when I tried to follow the General recommendations section to begin doing things like install a Windows Manager.</p>\n<p>Here’s the thing: based on the way the instructions were written, I assumed I just needed to install my video drivers, then Xorg, then Bumblebee (an open source implementation of Optimus) and I would be on my way. The problem is that, upon doing this, I was receiving all sorts of fun errors when attempting to load Xorg or run <code class=\"language-text\">optirun glxgears -info</code>. These errors were generally of the following fashion: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">systemd-logind: failed to get session</code> <code class=\"language-text\">PID XXX does not belong to any known session</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">could not detect any displays</code> </li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">could not detect any devices</code> </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem with these errors is that they are actually fairly common, which means they arise from a number of possible conditions. This led me to follow a number of support threads and sections of the Arch Wiki to no avail.</p>\n<p>After tinkering around with things for two full nights and stumbling upon various threads, I finally solved my problem. It turns out, I think, that my problem was as simple as not understanding the components of Xorg and what was actually necessary for it to draw to the screen. For starters, when I installed the Xorg packages, I didn’t realize that <code class=\"language-text\">pacman -S xorg</code> would not install <em>all</em> of the necessary dependencies when I select “all” for the packages to install. I actually had to manually install <code class=\"language-text\">xorg-server</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">xorg-utils</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">xorg-init</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">xorg-server-utils</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">xorg-term</code>. In addition, I didn’t realize that I had to copy over an <code class=\"language-text\">.xinitrc</code> file to my home directory and then include an <code class=\"language-text\">exec &lt;display manager&gt;</code> command in there somewhere. So, once I learned this and downloaded i3, I was able to point xinitrc to i3 and start up i3 just fine with the startx command.</p>\n<p>So, I’m off! It’s been a challenge so far, but I’ve already learned a lot. In particular, I’ve learned quite a bit about the newly integrated systemd, how Xorg works, and also a bit about editing Kernel configurations in the bootloader and working with basic networking.</p>\n<p>I can’t wait to see where this experiment takes me next!</p>\n<p>Oh, btw - I know these are heavy on words and light on images at the moment. Once I get to a point where I can take screenshots on the new box, I’ll work on getting some images in these posts!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/arch-i3-intro\">Intro</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/arch-i3-pt-2\">Part 2 - External Woes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/posts/arch-i3-pt-3\">Part 3 - Looking Good</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/arch-i3-pt-1","tagSlugs":["/tag/linux/","/tag/operating-systems/","/tag/development-environments/","/tag/tooling/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-05-18T23:46:37.121Z","description":"Part 1 of a technology log of installing Arch Linux and the i3 Tiling Window Manager.
