As expected, things did not go smoothly,\ninitially. One thing I enjoy about trying something like Arch out, however, is that you really get your hands dirty\nand have to work to achieve your goals.</p>\n<p>The first time I attempted this installation a little over a year ago, things went smoothly until I needed to install\nmy video drivers and attempt to have <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xorg">Xorg</a> display some basic output to\nmy screen. You see, the Dell Precision M4800 laptop I have actually comes with two video adapters (one integrated Intel\nand one high-performance Nvidia) which utilize a technology called\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Optimus">Nvidia Optimus</a>. The thing is, Nvidia is notorious for having proprietary\ndriver conflicts with Linux, and this technology only adds to that conundrum.</p>\n<p>It turns out this most recent install of Arch met with much the same fate. I was able to get a basic installation going\njust fine by following the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide">Arch Beginner\'s Guide</a>. The problem\ncame immediately after finishing this guide, when I tried to follow the General recommendations section to begin doing\nthings like install a Windows Manager.</p>\n<p>Here\'s the thing: based on the way the instructions were written, I assumed I just needed to install my video drivers,\nthen Xorg, then <a href="http://bumblebee-project.org/">Bumblebee</a> (an open source implementation of Optimus) and I would be on\nmy way. The problem is that, upon doing this, I was receiving all sorts of fun errors when attempting to load Xorg\nor run <code>optirun glxgears -info</code>. These errors were generally of the fashion "systemd-logind: failed to get session:\nPID XXX does not belong to any known session" or "could not detect any displays" or "could not detect any devices."\nThe problem with these errors is that they are actually fairly common, which means they arise from a number of possible\nconditions. This led me to follow a number of support threads and sections of the Arch Wiki to no avail.</p>\n<p>After tinkering around with things for two full nights and stumbling upon various threads, I finally solved my problem.\nIt turns out, I think, that my problem was as simple as not understanding the components of Xorg and what was actually\nnecessary for it to draw to the screen. For starters, when I installed the Xorg packages, I didn\'t realize that\n<code>pacman -S xorg</code> would not install all of the necessary dependencies when I select "all" for the packages to install.\nI actually had to manually install <code>xorg-server</code>, <code>xorg-utils</code>, <code>xorg-init</code>, <code>xorg-server-utils</code>, and <code>xorg-term</code>. In\naddition, I didn\'t realize that I had to copy over an <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xinitrc">.xinitrc</a> file\nto my home directory and then include an <code>exec &#x3C;display manager></code> command in there somewhere. So, once I learned this\nand downloaded i3, I was able to point xinitrc to i3 and start up i3 just fine with the <code>startx</code> command.</p>\n<p>So, I\'m off! It\'s been a challenge so far, but I\'ve already learned a lot. In particular, I\'ve learned quite a bit\nabout the newly integrated <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a>, how Xorg works, and also\na bit about editing Kernel configurations in the bootloader and working with basic networking.</p>\n<p>I can\'t wait to see where this experiment takes me next!</p>\n<p>Oh, btw - I know these are heavy on words and light on images at the moment. Once I get to a point where I can take\nscreenshots on the new box, I\'ll work on getting some images in these posts!</p>',timeToRead:3,frontmatter:{date:"August 11, 2015",title:"An Experiment with Arch and i3 Tiling Window Manager - Part 1",author:{id:"Bedford West"}}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/arch-pt1"}}}});
